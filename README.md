## Topic
fitting.py is the demo prograim of doing fitting. In this experiment, we want to do fitting to find out the interval and the width of the double-slit.
Because we have data of position of the optical fiber and the value of luminous, and we know the wavelength of laser, and the distance between fiber and laser. So using the function in lecture note, we can get the parameters a(width) and d(interval) 

## Step
1. Copy yout data to csv file, name it data.csv. First column for the position of fiber, and second column for luminous
2. Move data.csv to the path of this code
